This reminds me of that scene in Spider Man where the head of the newspaper has the Spider Suit hung on the wall and is repenting for some mean thing he said or something that he thinks made Spiderman leave the city.

Also, I'm betting you noticed how I wrote spydermun three different ways. Not really sure which is correct (except I don't think it's the last one).

On a more serious note, SM Is the bomb. (That means he's cool, in case your cuurent level of coolness has surpassed my archaic jargon.)

As I see it, this section is a warning against hypocrisy. You've always been bad about this (and often prided yourself on it). You are a seriously messed up human being, so get over yourself. Your friends will always be only human. Have high standards, but forgive easily. (See verses 1&2 above - whose job is it to judge?)

Stop resenting people forever for one thing. Don't let others poison your opinions. Wisdom is always welcome, but you must make and maintain friends and friendships for yourself and on your own.

I can still think of several people I've avoided being friends with becaue of one little think they did that I didn't like, as if I don't mess up scores of times each day. Jeb, Compton, Samantha, Sophia, Alexis, Diego, Zoey, Mckinely, Taylor, Hannah, Claire, Elena. I mean, even Dr. Browning, Mr. Billman, and in some small ways, Sydney. You are not better because of how you speak. (I'm reminded of the "I culd care less" xkcd.) If you don't remember some of the grevious offences [insert sarcasm here] the above individuals commited against me, that's good - both because you're learning to forgive and because the things they did might not even have been wrong, and, even if they were, they weren't against you really at all.

I'm off to continue reading. There's a lot in this book. Good thing I don't write this much on every verse :)

In them he has set a tent for l the sun, 5 m which comes out like n a bridegroom leaving his chamber, and, like a strong man, runs its course with joy. 6Its rising is from the end of the heavens, and its circuit to the end of them, and there is nothing hidden from its heat. 7 o The law of the LORD is perfect, [3] p reviving the soul; q the testimony of the LORD is r sure, s making wise t the simple; 8 u the precepts of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the LORD is v pure, w enlightening the eyes; 9the fear of the LORD is clean, enduring forever; the rules [4] of the LORD are x true, and righteous altogether. 10More to be desired are they than y gold, even much z fine gold; a sweeter also than honey and drippings of b the honeycomb. 11Moreover, by them is your servant warned; c in keeping them there is great reward. 12 d Who can discern his errors? e Declare me innocent from f hidden faults. 13 g Keep back your servant also from h presumptuous sins; let them not have i dominion over me! Then I shall be blameless, and innocent of great transgression. 14 Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight, O LORD, my j rock and my k redeemer.

God shows his love for us in that m while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. 9Since, therefore, n we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from o the wrath of God. 10For if p while we were enemies q we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by r his life. 11More than that, we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received s reconciliation.
